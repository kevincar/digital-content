# Class Lesson

The Temple provides two general functions:
1. The opportunity to perform ordinances for those who have died.
2. The chance to partake in these same ordinances for ourselves.
## Moral Cleanliness

**Note**: We will have a more thorough discussion on ordinances later, but discussing them briefly, now, is important to establish the relevant context for why worthiness matters.
### Ordinances

### Covenant

<blockquote style="text-aling: 'left';"><span lang="he" dir="rtl" style="font-family: 'New Peninim MT'; unicode-bidi: isolate;">&#xFB31;&#x05B0;&#x05E8;&#x05B4;&#x05EA;</span> is strictly nothing more than an eating together, banquet, since among Orientals, to eat together is almost the same as to make a covenant of friendship. The Hebrews too were accustomed to eat together when entering into a covenant (see Gen, 31: 54); and in this way we obtain an explanation of the word. It is used of a covenant entered into between nations (Josh. 6:9); between individuals and friends, (1 Sa. 18:3; 23:18); of a marriage covenant (Mal. 2:14)</blockquote>

Ordinances associated with a covenant require repentance—a change of heart.

## Tithing
[D&C 119:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/119?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) 

> Tithing is a principle that is fundamental to the personal happiness and well-being of the Church members worldwide, both rich and poor. Tithing is a principle of sacrifice and a key to the opening of the windows of heaven. … Members of the Church who do not tithe do not lose their membership; they only lose blessings<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1998/10/opening-the-windows-of-heaven?lang=eng&id=p6,p10#p6"><sup>2</sup></a> - James E.

## The Word of Wisdom

[Doctrine and Covenants 89](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89) 
- [Verses 1-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?lang=eng&id=p1-p9#p1): Harmful things
- [Verses 10–17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?id=p10-p17#p10): Helpful things
- [Verses 18–21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?id=p18-p21#p18): The Promise

[D&C 89:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?lang=eng&id=p18-p19#p18)

>Your body is the instrument of your mind. In your emotions, the spirit and the body come closest to being one. What you learn spiritually depends, to a degree, on how you treat your body. That is why the Word of Wisdom is so important. The habit-forming substances prohibited by that revelation﻿—tea, coffee, liquor, tobacco﻿—interfere with the delicate feelings of spiritual communication, just as other addictive drugs will do. Do not ignore the Word of Wisdom, for that may cost you the ‘great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures’ promised to those who keep it. And good health is an added blessing.<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1994/10/personal-revelation-the-gift-the-test-and-the-promise?lang=eng&id=p40-p42#p40"><sup>3</sup></a>


## The Sabbath Day

[Exodus 20:8-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/20.8-11?lang=eng) \
[Doctrine and Covenants 59:9–13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9-13?lang=eng)

>Why has God asked us to honor the Sabbath day? The reasons I think are at least threefold. The first has to do with the physical need for rest and renewing. The second reason is, in my opinion, of far greater significance. It has to do with the need for regeneration and the strengthening of our spiritual being. The third reason may be the most important of the three. It has to do with obedience to commandments as an expression of our love for God. Blessed are those who need no reasons other than their love for the Savior to keep his commandments.<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day?lang=eng&id=p30-p32#p30"><sup>4</sup></a>

## Temple Recommend Process

> The bishop has the responsibility of making inquiries into our personal worthiness. This interview is of great importance to you as a member of the Church, for it is an occasion to explore with an ordained servant of the Lord the pattern of your life. If anything is amiss in your life, the bishop will be able to help you resolve it. Through this procedure, as you counsel with the common judge in Israel, you can declare or can be helped to establish your worthiness to enter the temple with the Lord’s approval.<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng&id=p11#p11"><sup>5</sup></a>
